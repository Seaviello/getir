## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

1. `yarn start` for running both app and server
2. `yarn app` for running app
3. `yarn server` for running server

## General documentation and remarks

### Concerns about assignment itself

1. Size of the assignment exceeds any reasonable standards for job interview.
2. Using figma by default is a bold assumption that developer has access to that tool.
3. Palette of colours could be as separate file to see what exactly is used and how it is named and structured.
4. In case JSON-server is obligatory then having prepared data in db.json would be expected. Also I was quite surprise to not see `id` on those entities
